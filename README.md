Unit tetsing in Backend and Frontend to demonstrate my Unit tetsing skills but I have not written tests for all scenarios due to time factor.


Features I thought to add but couldn't due to time factor
- 100% unit test coverage
- Allow user to signup & login & Authorize the endpoint
- Store Order details in Database
- Display spinner on Http calls
- Handle http errors and display friendly message on screen
- UX improvements

Steps to Run application:
use git clone to clone the project to the local folder

Using Visual Studio:
Just Run/hit f5 to launch the application browser(This will take long for the first time to pull packages for UI and Backend)

Using command line:

Change directory to Ram.CodingTests.MyShop.CSProj folder
- Use 'Dotnet Build' to restore and build the app.
- Use Dotnet run to launch the app
- Navigate to the serving url
